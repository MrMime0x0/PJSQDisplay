# General Info
<br>Just know that this is a effort to create a display manager from Python and Javascript and then Qt languages plus i suck at coding so it will take a bit of time before i can fully start development on this project and PJSQDisplay just means Python, Javascript, Qt Display thats it nothing more nothing less.</br>

# About
<br>What if a display server was rootless and ran on the user level instead of root, That is PJSQDisplay and it works on allowing only the user your user to render the display and not root itself, Since we don't want root to run anything we will use JS or Javascript to render the backend stuff, And then Qt wraps around Javascript to give you a display of the desktop, While Javascript wraps around Python and this will allow Python to detect if a keylogger is running or keys are being monitored and it will detach the session while not interrupting the users workflow.</br>
